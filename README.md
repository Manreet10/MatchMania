# MatchMania
## Introduction
Purble Place is now a distant memory for many teens like me, but I vividly remember playing it as a child on the first laptop I ever bought. One of the three games was a memory game wherein we had to match the pair of pictures and score points. 
Match Mania is an easier and beginner friendly replica of the sweet memories of the childhood. 
Being able to implement the knowledge gained over the course of the study at Georgian to create something that I used as a kid, helps me reflect on the journey began to learn logic behind the beautifully working front-ends.

## Working
It works as follows:
Start shuffles the deck of images, and displays a gameboard on the screen. User clicks 2 tile. It checks whether the tiles are same. If yes, it removes the overlay background and disables event listener for click and increments the points.
In case, it doesn't match, the overlay background reappears and the user is able to click another 2 tiles and the process repeats. User also have an option to end the game and restart as pleased.
